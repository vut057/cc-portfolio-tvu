        For this assignment, our main focus was to incorporate class and objects to create an autobiographical game. Understanding class and objects led to other manipulations such as array of objects in combination with For Loops and random() to create multiples of one object in randomized origins. We were also able to create animation with these objects by applying conditional statements to these object classes with mouse and key inputs.

        Drawing from the lectures and readings that helped our perspective for this assignment, I decided to base my autobiographical game on my experiences as a first-generation asian american woman. The first stage of my game would show my avatar moving across the canvas where a white object would fall and be absorbed into my character while a sad face would be released. This is supposed to be a representation of my youth in which I shunned my asian identity to be more like my white peers. The second stage would be my avatar moving across the canvas to dodge male-representing enemies. This is supposed to represent the male gaze and fetishization of my asian body which is something I've experienced my whole life. The third stage would require my avatar to try interacting with ellipses. This stage would represent my social displacement in different racial communities based on the systematic structure of the asian minority myth.

        I'm disappointed that instead of completing full stages with dialogue and images, I focused more on making the code work for each stage. I think my initial goal was just to complete the project even with basic shapes but there is a level of anxiety that my game does not look as complete as other projects. I definitely struggled in completing my vision for the first stage even though it seemed to make sense in my mind.
