        Exquisite corpose is a surrealist technique where players take turns to draw a portion of a figure while not being able to see what has already been drawn by each other. The combined drawing is later revealed which creates unexpected forms and narratives.
        This concept was applied to this assignment in which we were to incorporate user-defined functions, arguments, and parameters. Although this assignment was meant to be collaborated with other students in the class, circumstances required me to rally a couple of my friends to hand draw their figures for me.    
      </p>
      <p>
        My design process first started in Adobe Illustrator where I planned my drawing with 2D primitive shapes so its likeness could be coded in p5. When I received the two other drawings, I observed which body sections I wanted to incorporate and created a combined image of all our figures. I think what I should've done to make the illustration-to-coding process easier for me was to initially resize the divided template to the p5 canvas size.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I found using user-defined functions, arguments and parameters a little confusing at first. But after working at it, I liked that it allowed me to organize my code better in function draw(). I didn't need to consider what user-defined functions needed to above the other to prevent overlapping, and it greatly reduced my lines of code because I was able to resuse my user-defined functions.

        This is Jadarot, an alien from Planet X who landed on Earth to learn about the human species for a mission. In order to blend in with the humans on Earth, Jadarot knew they needed to change their form. Walking out of the forest where they landed, Jadarot saw a vintage car show in an open parking lot with hundreds of people. As they were surveying the event, they saw a woman dressed in rockabilly attire who was getting a lot of attention from everybody. Jadarot figured that transforming into her would give them more opportunities to interact with humans. This is an image of Jadarot nearly finished with their transformation.

        Jamie Jo always knows where his next show is. He's a staple of the Portland indie music scene. The question is, how will he get in? WIll he help the band haul their gear and then hide in the bathroom? Do his old coworkers have a spare ticket? Maybe he's friends with the bouncer. Howerver it is he gets in, he's always leaving the same way. At closing, alone.

        Sharon started chicken keeping during the pandemic after learning more about food sovereignty. She got a rooster who isn't very winter hardy so she lets him roost inside her winter coat while she does garden chores.
