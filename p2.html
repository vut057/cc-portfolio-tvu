      <p>
        For this assignment, we were to use user-defined variables, random variables, and mousePressed functions to generate different versions of a face.

        Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
        Knowing I was a complete beginner with coding, I had initally thought I planned my sketches fairly simple enough to execute. The idea was that the smaller version of the face, which was a rectangle with curved corners, would lose its corner radius as it got smaller. In its smaller state, the expression of the character would looked "shocked" by flipping the triangluar mouth and removing the arc eyelashes. The final product would also have randomized lines in the background that would change end coordinates when the mouse was pressed.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        This proved to be much more difficult than I thought it would be. With my first iteration, I couldn't quite figure out how to keep the facial features within the face shape. However, I did figure out how to keep features symmetrical by using CENTER modes for my rectangles and ellipses which I used for my second iteration. A thing I figured out in my second iteration was if-else statements which allowed me to define when the face's corners would be squared off. When these corners are squared off, Iplan on using if-else statements to redraw the mouth to a frown.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Right now, my project still needs a lot of work. I really wanted the features to scale perfectly with the width and height of the face as it was randomized but, at the moment, I'm not very happy with the way the eyes looks severely skewed. I'm also having trouble with keeping the eyelashes connected with the pupils. In retrospect, it might have been more useful to use mouseX and mouseY coordinates, but I really wanted to learn this on my own and didn't want to copy the example's code.
